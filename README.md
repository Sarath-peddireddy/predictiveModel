Iris Flower Prediction
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. Using the classic Iris dataset, the model classifies the flower species into one of three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

Project Overview
The Iris dataset is widely used for classification tasks and is known for its simplicity and clarity. The dataset includes 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using these features, the model applies machine learning techniques to predict the species of an iris flower.

Key Features
Dataset: Inbuilt Iris dataset from sklearn.
Model: Utilizes supervised learning algorithms for multi-class classification.
Application: Built with Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface for predictions.
How to Use
Input the sepal and petal measurements of a flower.
The app will predict the species based on the input measurements.
